Information on the MSP430G2210:

Why you may like to use this MCU?
---------------------------------
Marc Ihle still has a lot of these devices (one roll with 1000 pieces).
You may use them for free (no, not all at once ;-) for this project. However, if you prefer another MCU, go ahead.

Caution: This is a low-voltage MSP. Do not apply voltages >3.6V. Use a voltage regulator if needed.

Debugger:
---------
We have 2 pieces of MSP-FET Flash Emulator Tools available.
You can use it to program the MCU via SpiBiWire (a JTAG version with reduced pin count, as the MCU has only 8 pins).
In addition, we have two programmer from the eval-kit eZ430-RF2500. They also work as SpiBiWire-interface for this MCU.
Please contact Marc Ihle, if you use one of these debugger interfaces.

Pin-Configuration of eZ430-RF2500 programmer:
Pin 1: TX             
Pin 2: 3.6V           
Pin 3: TEST, SBWTCK   white
Pin 4: /RST, SBWTDIO  blue/red
Pin 5: GND            brown
Pin 6: RX             

How to connect these emulators to the pins to the MSP430G2210:
Pin 1: DVCC = VCC     use the power from a battery (1.8V up to 3.6V)
Pin 2: I/O
Pin 3: I/O
Pin 4: I/O
Pin 5: I/O
Pin 6: /RST, SBWTDIO  blue/red
Pin 7: TEST, SBWTCK   white
Pin 8: DVSS = GND     brown

Pin-Configuration of MSP-FET Flash Emulator Tool:
- See back of the emulator
- See page 23 of https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau278y/slau278y.pdf for details on how
  to connect this emulator. If you don't want to blow the JTAG-fuse of the device,
  you may omit R2 and connect JTAG-Pin 7 (TCK) directly to Pin 7 (TEST) of the MSP,
  without connecting JTAG-Pin 8 (TEST/VPP).


Features:
---------
This MCU is very small in size, but with reasonable large SMD-pins, so that it may be soldered by hand.
It has Schmitt-trigger Inputs as well as comparator inputs. These can be used to detect analog voltages.
The threshold can be set to either  25% or 50% of the power supply voltage.
The device consumes nearly no power in power-down mode and still few power during normal operation.
Therefore, you can omit a power switch.
